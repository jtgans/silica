* The core of the Navi operating environment

Silica is the core bits of the Navi operating environment, and part of the [[https://github.com/jtgans/navi][Navi
Project]].

For now, this is just a stub project until the Gypsum code is fleshed out more.
Eventually this project will contain the various applications and services that
will make up the UI and main applications the user interacts with, including a
graphical REPL, debugger, and browser for the host lisp system.
